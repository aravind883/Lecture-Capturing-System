# Lecture-Communication-System

This project digitalizes the process of asking or clarifying the doubts of audience in an Lecture or in an Presentation where there are over hundreds of attendees. The attendees can ask doubt through the client portal and the presenter's system receives the doubts and displays them so that the presenter can clear the doubts. The presenter can ask questions as well to the attendees.


First of all, download and extract

To execute this project, you'll have to run two files :

1) Go to "LCSHost\src\main\java" in Command Prompt(for Windows)(use respective prompts for your OS) and give "java Main_Host".
2) Go to "LCSClient\src\main\java" in Command Prompt and give "java Main_Client". 
3) Now type the IP Address and Port Number displayed in Host side in the Client side of the interface.

Note : You should have only one host running. But you can have more than one client running at the same time. You'll have to connect all the clients with host with the IP Address and Port Number.

Note : You should connect all the devices in same network (Wifi or Ethernet).

Thank You!!
